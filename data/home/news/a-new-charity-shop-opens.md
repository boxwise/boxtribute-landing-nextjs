blog_text: <p>In August 2021, The Free Shop Lebanon started their operations. Focused
  on distribution to refugee families in Lebanon with full freedom of choice, The
  Free Shop was completely set up around the technology offered by Boxtribute. As
  The Free Shop is fully run by a refugee team with limited humanitarian experience,
  many core operations such as tracking the availability of aid stock, storing beneficiary
  contact details and collecting distribution data are all things they couldn't do
  without Boxtribute technology. We were deeply involved in the setup process, supporting
  them with frequent calls to set them up for success as they became completely independent.</p><p><img

  Boxtribute The Free Shop would not be where it is today. We were visited recently
  by our core funder (Choose Love) who said we were the most organized project they
  met in Lebanon! They were so impressed with how we know our warehouse stock and
  store the phone numbers of over 2,000 Syrian families safely."<br>-</em> Khaled,
  The Free Shop Manager</p>
