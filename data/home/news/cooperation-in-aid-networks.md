title: Collective Grassroot Response in Humanitarian Aid
headline: and how we want to support it
blog_text: '<p>Local grassroots nonprofits are pivotal as first responders in humanitarian crises, often outperforming international NGOs (INGOs) in delivering aid that precisely meets the needs of the affected communities¹. They provide rapid, cost-effective assistance and are integral to the resilience and empowerment of local communities. Despite being recognized for their critical role, local entities face systemic challenges that prevent their inclusion in higher level conversations on humanitarian policy and aid response, diminishing their impact and limiting the overall effectiveness of the humanitarian aid ecosystem.</p><p>In our years of experience working with and within them, we have observed several core challenges:</p><p><strong>Information Management</strong>: Critical data within these organizations is often fragmented, unrecorded, or mishandled, not adhering to regulations such as GDPR. Furthermore, organizations often struggle to effectively analyze and share what data they do have, and are unable to use it to inform their decisions over short timeframes.² This can damage trust with both beneficiaries and donors due to lack of transparency, as well as hinder operations due to poor resource allocation and continuous knowledge loss.</p><p><strong>Coordination:</strong> Grassroots entities face large obstacles to coordination in a fragmented aid delivery landscape. While larger INGOs benefit from centralization and shared standards, individual nuances in community groups’ methods makes coordinating interventions more challenging, particularly when reliable information on both needs and active operations in the area is scarce.</p><p><strong>Research and Innovation Gaps:</strong> There is a lack of data around community-led responses³, which limits academic research and by extension, the influence of community-led initiatives on the wider humanitarian sector. This has multiple knock-on effects, including restricting access to resources that might have been allocated to invest in innovations and scale methods proven to be effective.</p><p><strong>Resource Limitations:</strong> Grassroots organizations consistently operate with limited access to both funding and human capital, which restricts their ability to maintain, replicate, and improve their services, ultimately affecting their resilience and long-term potential.</p><p>These issues underscore the need for a systemic overhaul that directly addresses the operational challenges of grassroots nonprofits, allowing them to transform into more resilient and empowered actors within the humanitarian aid sector.</p><p></p><br/><h4>What do we want to do?</h4><br/><p>Boxtribute`s vision is to transform the way grassroots humanitarian organizations operate within the larger humanitarian sector through an embedded, bottom-up approach that enhances their visibility and supercharges their operations.</p><p>Building upon our existing humanitarian logistics product, Boxtribute seeks to create a collaborative platform that amalgamates cooperative functionalities at a regional level. We plan to surface live data on both aid availability (e.g., in stock supply of hygiene items across the network) and delivery (e.g., recent beneficiary distributions), making data that was previously siloed away usable for operational decision-making by the network as a whole.</p><p>Boxtribute partners will have the option to automatically publish their operational data either publicly or to a selected network of trusted partners. The published data will then be processed by Boxtribute software into actionable insights and user-friendly visualizations embedded directly within the platform, facilitating more coordinated crisis response efforts that are self-organized at the local level.</p><p>Key features and strategies of Boxtribute for achieving this include:</p><p><strong>Collaboration through Data Sharing:</strong> Enable organizations to view and share real-time data on aid availability and distribution operations, streamlining the process of locating needed resources and reducing the risk of duplicated efforts.</p><p><strong>Out-of-the-Box System Interoperability:</strong> Data sharing and related collaboration capabilities designed to work out-of-the-box through sensible defaults, requiring no extra data entry or manual configuration from organizations or their team members.</p><p><strong>Transparency for Impact:</strong> Improving the actionability of data by consolidating it across organizations and presenting it in context so that organizations can make more informed decisions based on up-to-date information. This will be supplemented by tools for organizations to communicate their impact more effectively, improving their reputation and increasing their chances of garnering additional resources.</p><p>To ensure the successful transformation of Boxtribute into a platform, we have these first two steps in mind:</p><p><strong>1. Feature Extension:</strong> Develop and enhance the current Boxtribute product to fit the operations of various user groups identified as critical for our platform`s success. This stage will guarantee regular engagement and establish a pipeline of data that can be centrally monitored for quality and consistency, paving the way for the platform`s sustainability.</p><p><strong>2. Aid Availability Mapping MVP:</strong> Building on the enhanced features, we will create an MVP focused on sharing live data of available aid supply within a region. Boxtribute already has existing partners who are prominent suppliers in the field eager to participate in this MVP. The unique value proposition of this platform, combined with network effects, is expected to attract and retain more users.</p><br/><hr><p><a href="https://www.oecd.org/development/humanitarian-donors/docs/Localisingtheresponse.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>¹ OECD (2017)</strong>.
