headline: An Impact Highlight from 2021
text: Sea-Eye is a civil rescue NGO working in the Mediterranean Sea and has been
  active since 2015. With the rescue organisation, Sophie assisted people on the move
  as a Rhib communicator, which essentially means she was the first point of contact
  with the boat in distress, helping to calm and control the situation.

short_text: Our focus in 2021 moved from expanding end distribution capabilities to
  securing critical aid supplies in the field. We made four new partners with charities
  situated in Germany and the UK, who had many of the needed supplies due to their
  strong network of local aid collection in their home cities, collecting over 390,000
  items in 2021.
blog_text: '<p>Humanitarian actors experienced the knock-on effects of 2021 global
  supply chain constraints, which created bottlenecks in the Euro area at historically
  high levels¹. These constraints had a direct physical impact of intensifying aid
  shortages in the field. In addition, the ongoing effects of COVID-19 through the
  year, combined with health guidelines restricting gatherings of people, made it
  difficult for many charities to physically operate and distribute aid.</p><p><img

  1: How many items of aid were moved through our partners warehouses by product category
  and year.</em></p><p>Therefore, our focus in 2021 moved from expanding end distribution
  capabilities to securing critical aid supplies in the field. We made four new partners
  with charities situated in Germany and the UK, who had many of the needed supplies
  due to their strong network of local aid collection in their home cities, collecting
  over 390,000 items in 2021. By working with those partners, we were able to both
  improve their internal aid collection processes, as well as facilitate smooth and
  rapid outward deliveries to crisis hotspots in the field.</p><p>An example of our
  impact on the whole supply chain was the collection, delivery and distribution of
  more than 100,000 FFP2 masks in April 2021. These masks were vital to distribute
  in refugee camps to keep them from becoming pandemic centres. This was possible
  thanks to a collaboration between our two partners Grenzenlose Wärme, one of our
  new aid collecting partners, and IHA, a distribution centre based in Northern Greece.
  This connection was made possible thanks to Boxtribute, as was the ability for them
  to coordinate operations by seeing who had which items in which warehouse locations
  at what time. Without Boxtribute’s support, such a transparent mass distribution
  would not have been possible.</p>'
