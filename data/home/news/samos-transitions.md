title: Samos Transitions
headline: An Impact Highlight from 2021
short_text: 'Twice in 2021, CRI distributions were handed over from one organisation
  to another: in February 2021 from Refugee4Refugees to Drop in the Ocean, and in
  August 2021 from Drop in the Ocean to Samos Volunteers. It was only because all
  three of them were using Boxtribute that we were able to secure a continuous availability
  of distributions without any interruptions.'
blog_text: '<p>Samos is a Greek Islands, close to the Turkish coast, and therefore
  one of the biggest hotspots for arrivals of refugees in the EU by sea. The main
  camp on Samos was Vathy, which was set up to host about 650 people in 2015 and over
  the next five years came to host over 7,000. Many people lived in makeshift tents
  in inhumane conditions.¹ Over the past year, Samos residents faced further upheavals
  when due to the violence and chaos created during 2020 Moria fires, Vathy camp was
  closed down by the Greek government in preparation for replacement by a new closed
  camp.²</p><p>With only one central NGO present to handle core relief item (CRI)
  distributions for thousands of Samos residents, the smooth transition of operations
  was of utmost importance during these upheavals. Twice this year, CRI distributions
  were handed over from one organisation to another: in February 2021 from Refugee4Refugees
  to Drop in the Ocean, and in August 2021 from Drop in the Ocean to Samos Volunteers.
  It was only because all three of them were using Boxtribute that we were able to
  secure a continuous availability of distributions without any interruptions. We
  consulted all three organisations throughout the transition processes, transferring
  about 1,200 boxes (about 100,000 aid items) and data on former distributions each
  time.</p><p></p><p></p><hr><p><strong>¹ Marion MacGregor, </strong><a href="https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/41291/jungle-to-prison-for-migrants-on-samos-island"
