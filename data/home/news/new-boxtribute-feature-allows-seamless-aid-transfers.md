Using this, two aid organisations who are linked with each other on the platform, can send donations and receive it into their stock by simply scanning the attached bar codes.</p><p>Boxtribute is very excited to announce the launch of our "Transfers" feature. Over the past year, the Boxtribute Team worked on a solution for our partners to be able to transfer boxes between them by simply scanning (mobile version) or allocating them to a shipment (desktop version). Both sending and receiving teams will be able to monitor planned shipments live as they are packed, sent, and received at the destination. This feature will save sending and receiving groups time and resources spent on relabelling boxes and manually entering data to update their current stock. Boxes once sent out from one organisation`s warehouse can now be accepted straight to any location in the other organisation’s warehouse by the click of a button, literally!</p><p>This is a huge help for crisis response groups, where time and effective management of resources is of the utmost importance. Aid sending groups who would have to usually spend hours on creating, communicating, and coordinating shipment lists can now skip this process entirely. On the receiving end, it creates a stress free delivery for groups working on the ground in emergency situations.  Viewing where stock is within the warehouse and what comes in to make it simple for distribution to beneficiaries.</p><p>HERMINE e.V., a volunteer-run aid collection association that sends tens of thousands of relief aid items each year is one such group that has benefited from these new developments. Logistics coordinator Valentin Seigne, had this to say: <i>”Boxtribute’s new transfer capability [...] lowers the threshold for volunteers to get involved. By making workflows more intuitive, preparing pallets for dispatch becomes more of a team effort as less experienced coordination is required.”</i></p><p><i>“A good crisis response is one where people who need help get the aid they need quickly and efficiently. Grassroots groups and community-led initiatives are some of the most critical players in making that possible,”</i> said Roanna Kong, Executive Director for Boxtribute. <i>“Providing that aid in a coordinated way is a key part of making sure a relief operation is successful. We are committed to enabling a better future for all those in need.”</i></p>'
