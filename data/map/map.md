    The Free Shop is a project which makes a difference. We do not only bring people these items, but provide them with the freedom to choose the specific items they need themselves. Without anyone deciding it for them.

    Through The Free Shop we aspire to improve the quality of life in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. Everyone is different: each family has different needs. The Free Shop has been built with exactly this in mind.

    In the heart of Nea Kavala camp A Drop in the Ocean support displaced persons by organizing various activities such as non-formal education for adults, activities for women, and youth.
