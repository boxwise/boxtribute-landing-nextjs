    The Free Shop is a project which makes a difference. We do not only bring people these items, but provide them with the freedom to choose the specific items they need themselves. Without anyone deciding it for them.

    Through The Free Shop we aspire to improve the quality of life in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. Everyone is different: each family has different needs. The Free Shop has been built with exactly this in mind.

    Boxtribute's first prototype was created here in 2016/2017.

    In the heart of Nea Kavala camp A Drop in the Ocean support displaced persons by organizing various activities such as non-formal education for adults, activities for women, and youth. We also support integration efforts through our InfoHub. The team distributes clothes, food and other non-food items to meet the needs of the camp residents.
    Since September 2022, A Drop in the Ocean has started operating in Alexandria camp, distributing food and non-food items. Our main goal is further to expand our support with the implementation of activities.
