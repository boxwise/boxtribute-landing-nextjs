    Since July 2018, Collective Aid has been supporting people on the move stuck in Bosnia and Herzegovina through multiple outlets and projects.

    We are currently distributing essential aid like underwear, socks, hygiene packs, clothing, sleeping bags and shoes to people who are sleeping rough around Sarajevo. We collaborate closely with other organizations on the ground on identification and referral of potential cases for basic legal aid and medical interventions. In July 2021 we took over a Glasses Project from another organization. Collective Aid now works together in partnership with a local optician to help people on the move get fitting glasses for themselves

    by trucks of up to 40 tonnes. The logistics center is linked to a growing logistics
    network of EU countries and imports donations in kind to Ukraine. These are delivered
    by our Ukrainian drivers as needed. This system avoids that donations which are
    not needed are distributed and take up storage capacity. The drivers are familiar
    with the area and well networked, so that they are informed about the current
    situation and can not only use humanitarian corridors, but also create them.

    of donations in kind of clothing, hygiene items and food packages.
