    aid, benefitting thousands of refugees in Northern Greece. We source supplies
    locally and receive aid deliveries from abroad. Supplies are stocked in the warehouse
    and distributed to refugees by our volunteer team and partner organisations. This
    support network serves eleven camps and a number of urban projects in the region.
    Our approach is needs-based and flexible. We focus on closing supply gaps, providing
    for refugees who lack institutional support and on responding to emergencies.  '

    The Free Shop is a project which makes a difference. We do not only bring people these items, but provide them with the freedom to choose the specific items they need themselves. Without anyone deciding it for them.

    Through The Free Shop we aspire to improve the quality of life in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. Everyone is different: each family has different needs. The Free Shop has been built with exactly this in mind.
